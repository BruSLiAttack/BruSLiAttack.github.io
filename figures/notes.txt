# README 

This is for releasing the source code of the paper "Query Efficient Decision Based Sparse Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models" 

Archived Version: [SparseEvo Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00091).

Poster: [ICLR 2022 Poster](https://github.com/SparseEvoAttack/SparseEvoAttack.github.io/blob/main/image/ICLR%202022%20-%20poster%207.png)

The project is published as part of the following paper and if you re-use our work, please cite the following paper:


```
@inproceedings{vo2022,
title={Query Efficient Decision Based Sparse Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models},
author={Viet Quoc Vo and Ehsan Abbasnejad and Damith C. Ranasinghe},
year = {2022},
journal = {International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)},
}
```

The source code is written mostly on *Python 3* and *Pytorch*, so please help to download and install Python3 and Pytorch beforehand.

# Requirements

To install the requirements for this repo, run the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/SparseEvoAttack/SparseEvoAttack.github.io.git
cd SparseEvoAttack
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Download a pretrained model for CIFAR-10 evaluation set [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_F6R_zNqj2q2GFhwPYypBE6cCFOldtDv/view?usp=sharing). 

# Evaluate SparseEvoAttack

Run step-by-step with the Jupyter Notebook file *'Tutorial - Evaluate Sparse Attacks on CIFAR10.ipynb'*. 
  
## TODO 
- [ ] Add the testing code.
